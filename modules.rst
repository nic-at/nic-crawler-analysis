API Documentation
=================

Building requires some additional softwre packages to be
installed. To install them run the following command from
the root folder of the package:
::

    pip install -r requirements_docs.txt


To build the API documentation you can then run 
::

    cd docs/
    make html

You can then open *docs/build/html/index.html* using
your favorite web browser.
